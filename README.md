# Data Mining the Yelp Open Dataset

## Description:

1. Are there optimal operating hours and locations for different categories of businesses?

2. What makes a review vote tagged as Useful, Funny, or Cool with respect to the review's text and star rating?

3. What are common features of 1-star (negative) and 5-star (positive) text reviews for different categories of business?

4. Are there clusters of Yelp users who more frequently give positive or negative reviews? What is common among these users?
